# Comparative-study-between-different-architecture-of-CNN-for-plant-diseases-classfication
We are trying to develop deep learning model to identify the disease in potato crop
after analyzing the images of leaves.
We will perform a comparative study between 2 different architecture of CNN and
compare which of architecture outperform with respect to accuracy parameter
In the context of plant disease prediction, a CNN could be trained on a large
dataset of potato leaves images, both healthy and diseased, to learn the
characteristics of each type of disease. The CNN would learn to identify common
features in the images, such as discoloration, spot patterns, or wilting, that are
indicative of certain diseases
