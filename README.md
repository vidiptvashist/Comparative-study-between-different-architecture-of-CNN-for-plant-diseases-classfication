# Comparative-study-between-different-architecture-of-CNN-for-plant-diseases-classfication
We are trying to develop deep learning model to identify the disease in potato crop
after analyzing the images of leaves.
We will perform a comparative study between 2 different architecture of CNN and
compare which of architecture outperform with respect to accuracy parameter
In the context of plant disease prediction, a CNN could be trained on a large
dataset of potato leaves images, both healthy and diseased, to learn the
characteristics of each type of disease. The CNN would learn to identify common
features in the images, such as discoloration, spot patterns, or wilting, that are
indicative of certain diseases

## Abstract
At the present, industry professionals are frequently required to identify potato infections directly, which is a process that is both time demanding and prone to errors. It requires a significant
amount of time and effort to examine each plant for illness and, if it does, to identify the specific type of illness that the plant is suffering from. In addition, not every form of illness can be
accurately recognised by simply using a person’s naked sight. As a direct consequence of this,
producers are already making use of artificial intelligence in order to fully systematise the process
of diagnosing plant diseases. An automated system that makes use of computer vision to provide
producers with assistance in recognising plant illnesses.As a result, we have recommended using
artificial intelligence to diagnose plant diseases and to automate the complete system. To do this,
we have proposed a deep learning model as well as several Transfer Learning models. In order to
determine which of CNN’s two alternative architectures delivers the most accurate results, we will
carry out a comparative research study contrasting the two of them. A CNN could be educated
using a sizeable data set consisting of photographs of healthy and diseased potato leaves in order
to gain an understanding of the characteristics of each type of sickness. CNN would become skilled
at recognising typical symptoms that indicate illness in the photographs, such as withering, spot
patterns, or discoloration.Because agriculture is the primary source of revenue for approximately
70 percent of India’s population and the potato is one of the most widely grown and consumed
vegetables on a global scale, the initiative is significant because of these two factors. The fact that
numerous diseases can have a detrimental influence on the quantity and quality of potato crops
highlights the importance of timely disease discovery and efficient disease management. The application of CNNs for the purpose of picture classification has seen widespread adoption across a
variety of industries, including agribusiness. However, there is a dearth of research on the quantitative analysis of various CNN architectures for the categorization of potato diseases. The purpose of
this project is to close this knowledge gap by analysing how well VGG-16 and AlexNet execute on
this specific assignment. The findings of this initiative will allow farmers and researchers to more
accurately pinpoint potato diseases, which will ultimately lead to disease management techniques
that are more efficient and effective.
